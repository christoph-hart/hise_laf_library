# HISE LAF Code Library

A public library of HISE UI Customizations (LookAndFeel) with contributions from various developers.

This repository contains code examples and snippets for various examples of how to use a look and feel class to customize HISE UI widgets. In order to contribute to this repository, write [me](https://forum.hise.audio/user/christoph-hart) or [orange](https://forum.hise.audio/user/orange) a PM in the HISE forum so we can add you as contributor. In order to keep things tidy, please stick to the following guidelines

## Structure

This project is a valid HISE repository which you can check out and load different examples to port over to your project. This has the advantage that image files (if you need them in your example, but please avoid them if possible to keep the repo size small enough).

Please make a single HiseScript file per example which you'll include in the `onInit` callback of your example snippet. Instead of a snippet, we'll use the good ol' .hip file format for example projects that use this file. You can then edit the Examples.md file and add a screenshot with a link to the code file so people can easily see how it was done (this will keep out the screenshot files from spamming the repository because GitHub saves them god knows where).

## License

These examples in here should be usable in other projects with no copyleft restrictions, so please only submit examples here that you can bear to see them in other projects with a minimal amount of customization :)
